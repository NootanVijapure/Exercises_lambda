## Exercise 1: Lambda Expressions

Instructions:Write a program that uses lambda expressions to perform various operations on a list of integers.

1.  Create a list of integers.
    
2.  Use lambda expressions to:a. Filter the list to get only even numbers.b. Map each element to its square.c. Reduce the list to find the sum of all elements.
    
3.  Print the results.
    

## Exercise 2: Streams

Instructions:Write a program that demonstrates the use of streams to perform operations on a collection of strings.

1.  Create a list of strings.
    
2.  Use streams to:a. Filter the list to get strings starting with letter 'A'.b. Convert each string to uppercase.c. Concatenate all strings into a single string.
    
3.  Print the final concatenated string.
    

## Exercise 3: Java Modules and Localization

Instructions:Write a modularized program that demonstrates localization using resource bundles.

1.  Create a modularized project with two modules: 'app' and 'localization'.
    
2.  In the 'localization' module, create resource bundles for English and French languages containing key-value pairs for greetings.
    
3.  In the 'app' module, load the appropriate resource bundle based on the user's preferred language and display a greeting message.
    
4.  Provide support for at least English and French languages.
    

## Exercise 4: Sorting with Lambda Expressions

Instructions:Write a program that uses lambda expressions to sort a list of strings.

1.  Create a list of strings with various lengths and contents.
    
2.  Use lambda expressions to:a. Sort the list in ascending order of string lengths.b. Sort the list in descending order of string lengths.c. Sort the list alphabetically ignoring case.
    
3.  Print the sorted lists after each operation.
    

## Exercise 5: Filtering with Streams

Instructions:Write a program that demonstrates filtering using streams on a list of objects.

1.  Create a class **Person** with attributes: name, age, and city.
    
2.  Create a list of **Person** objects with various attributes.
    
3.  Use streams to filter the list based on:a. Persons aged 30 and above.b. Persons living in a specific city.
    
4.  Print the filtered lists after each operation.
